Pypianoroll is an open source Python library for working with piano rolls. It provides essential tools for handling multitrack piano rolls, including efficient I/O as well as manipulation, visualization and evaluation tools.


Features
========

- Manipulate multitrack piano rolls intuitively
- Visualize multitrack piano rolls beautifully
- Save and load multitrack piano rolls in a space-efficient format
- Parse MIDI files into multitrack piano rolls
- Write multitrack piano rolls into MIDI files


Why Pypianoroll
===============

Our aim is to provide convenient classes for piano-roll matrix and MIDI-like track information (program number, track name, drum track indicator). Pypianoroll is also designed to provide efficient I/O for piano rolls, since piano rolls have long been considered an inefficient way to store music data due to the sparse nature.


Installation
============

To install Pypianoroll, please run ``pip install pypianoroll``. To build Pypianoroll from source, please download the `source <https://github.com/salu133445/pypianoroll/releases>`_ and run ``python setup.py install``.


Documentation
=============

Documentation is available `here <https://salu133445.github.io/pypianoroll>`_ and as docstrings with the code.

Lakh Pianoroll Dataset
======================

`Lakh Pianoroll Dataset <https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/dataset>`_ (LPD) is a new multitrack piano roll dataset using Pypianoroll for efficient data I/O and to save space, which is used as the training dataset in our `MuseGAN <https://salu133445.github.io/musegan>`_ project.
